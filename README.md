# Description

An implementation of Sugyamas algorithm for displaying a layered graph.

Currently, only x-coordinate assignment is implemented. The implementation follows the algorithm provided by Brandes and Koepf, which can be found in this [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fast-and-Simple-Horizontal-Coordinate-Assignment-Brandes-K%C3%B6pf/69cb129a8963b21775d6382d15b0b447b01eb1f8).
